## To develop the simulator
```
cd javascript
gulp
```
This will start the simulator with default layout and compile simulator client code from `/javascript/simulator/client`.  This will also start watchers that will reload the browser when files in `/javascript/simulator/client` are saved.

Open browser to http://localhost:3000
