# Lidar Information
HOE is using a 360 degree 8 level IR Lidar to track obects approaching the structure, potentially as far away as 90 feet.  We will use this information to switch between animation modes in the strucutre, and produce interesting lighting effects without users inside the structure.  For example, as people approach, the light can start to move to their direction, inticing them to enter.
